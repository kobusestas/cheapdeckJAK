Info on the CheapDeck MacroPad I printed and setup.
I printed this using https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4303318 design.

I created this repo so there was more info on KMK configs out there as I felt like there wasn't a ton for what I wanted to do that walked me through it 100%.

For the Mute Mic function I used this Windows Power Toys feature: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/video-conference-mute
